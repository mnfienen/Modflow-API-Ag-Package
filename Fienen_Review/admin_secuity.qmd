No issues of concern were raised in this administrative security review. The following items were evaluated for the administrative software review. My findings are included in _italics_ below each item.

1. Personally identifiable information (PII)  
_None found._
2. Absolute file system paths  
_All paths are relative, which in addition to better security ensures portability. Celever use was made of internal functions to direct some paths to installed packages without reporting absolute paths._
3. Internal server host names or IP addresses  
_None found._
4. Usernames/passwords  
_None found._
